We are all IT students, right? During our studies, we all have used linux in a virtual  machine
and are still using, so I suppose that all of you have complained about how super slow a 
virtual machine is and how much time it takes to install and to configure it. We need a solution, we don't want to spend 2 hours installing a simple
linux virtual machine, do we?  

Fortunately, Windows has found the solution which I will be presenting to you today.
WSL, also known as the windows subsystem for linux is the ultimate solution for people, 
studens, developers, like us, who wants or needs to use linux alongside windows.

What is WSL? Wsl is a feature of the windows OS that enables you to run a linux file system,
along with linux command line tools and GUI apps, directly on your windows machine alongside
your windows desktop and app.

Before Wsl was introduced, there were only 2 ways to use linux alongside Windows.

For example, you can use a virtualization software like vmware of vbox to install a 
virtual machine, or you can dualboot your windows machine with linux.

Now, both of them require a lot of time to install, dualbooting is even pretty dangerous if 
you run up to some errors, you can completely destroy your Windows machine. And a virtual 
machine, we already know how slow and buggy it works.

So instead of those 2 options, You should use WSL.
Why? Because it is so easy and simple to insall and configure. It does not ask for any 
effort and you won't have any headaches.

Besides, It is much faster and reliable than a dualboot or a vm. It also does not require a lot of resources like 
a vm, You have to give a vm a lot of resources like RAM, cpu which even does not make it faster right.

At last but not least, for me the most important feature is that you can easily access your windows file system inside your
linux file system and vice versa.
